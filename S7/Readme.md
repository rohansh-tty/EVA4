    Run this network (Links to an external site.).  
    Fix the network above:
        change the code such that it uses GPU
        change the architecture to C1C2C3C40 (basically 3 MPs)
        total RF must be more than 44
        one of the layers must use Depthwise Separable Convolution
        one of the layers must use Dilated Convolution
        use GAP (compulsory):- add FC after GAP to target #of classes (optional)
        achieve 80% accuracy, as many epochs as you want. Total Params to be less than 1M.
